\chapter{Methodology and rigor}

The methodology has been followed by the thesis author as best as
the circumstances permitted during each phase of developent, despite
changes in planning.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The scrum methodology has been loosely followed: A weekly build has
been produced, but other principles have just been partially implemented, such as the sprint board in Trello
or the consistent feedback with the thesis supervisor, that has been a bit scarce in the beginning of the final game development. This happened because the thesis author did not consider necessary to do so, although, in retrospective, it may have been positive for the project's development.

\item Entries in the development blog have been consistently uploaded and have provided
a good feedback channel between the director and the author.

\item Communication with beta testers has been done with WhatsApp, a free instant messaging app, instead of Slack. This occurred because most beta testers already had WhatsApp installed on their devices, and are more familiar with it. It has in no way impaired the collection of information on the developer part.

\end{enumerate}
