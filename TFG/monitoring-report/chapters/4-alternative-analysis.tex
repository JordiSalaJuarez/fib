\chapter{Analysis of alternatives}

Some problems have arisen during the development. Due to time constraints, one of the projects hase been left undone. There only is a GDD detailing the initial idea of it. The remaining two were done successfully, and we think that the remaining one, although a bit challenging to develop, can shed light to the public's conception of sustainable natural resource management. This is a minor inconvenience in the project, as the unfinished prototype has not been thought as a convenient way to represent the project's objectives.

This inconvenience has it's positive side, as now the team does not need to sink more time into the prototype development phase and can now focus on developing the final project.
