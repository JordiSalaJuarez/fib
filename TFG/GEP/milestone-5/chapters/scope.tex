\chapter{Summary of the analysis of scope}

The project will mainly consist of three separate phases of development. As this work will follow agile principles, each phase will consist of short sprints of condensed work, and the general flow of the project may not be entirely linear. For example, After interviewing some players, the Developer might detect a design problem in the game, and they will go back to phase 2 for solving the problem.

\section{Prototype development}

Based on current research, Various prototypes for the final game will be developed. During this phase player feedback and rapid iteration will be key for sorting out non-working prototypes and for finding the best candidate for the next phase. 

\section{Final game development}

This phase will transform the best prototype out of all the ones developed in the previous section into a fully-fledged, ready to be distributed mobile game. During this phase, constant communication with the thesis supervisor and some NGO's interested in the project will be very important for bringing in ideas and weight out features to add to the final work. 

\section{Player interviewing}

Once the final game is tested and ready to be deployed, this phase will begin. Through collaboration with other NGO's, a series of player interviews will be done. Conclusions about the effectiveness of the game for transmitting the ideas laid out by the project's objectives.
