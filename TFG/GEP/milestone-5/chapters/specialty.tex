\chapter{Justification of speciality}

Computation is the chosen speciality for developing this project instead of
the other ones offered in the Bachelor.

This project requires of a lot of optimisation and efficient problem solving
given the platform the final game will be distributed through. This specailty
offers its students the necessary knowledge to optimise algorithms and 
build efficient solutions to complex problems, this quality being essential
for the correct implementation of this project's final game.

The curriculum of this specialty also includes computer graphics, a field
very much related to video games and interactive experiences. The knowledge
obtained from it can be very beneficial to the project.

The specialty also gives its students broad knowledge about the different
programming languages and its main pros and cons, this being a very important
to assess which technology can be used to solve best the problems and challenges
laid out by this project's objectives.
