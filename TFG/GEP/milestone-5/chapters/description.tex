\chapter{Description of the project's objectives}

The objectives of this project are

\begin{itemize}
\item Study current teaching methods for educating people about environmental sustainability.
\item Compare and choose the method that can be best transformed into a mobile gaming experience.
\item Implement the method as a mobile game.
\item Analyze its impact on players by a face-to-face post-play interview.
\end{itemize}

The ultimate goal of the project is to extract valuable information on wether
if mobile gaming can be oriented towards teaching about sustainability or it
is a flawed platform to teach such concepts.

Furthermore, the project's conclussions should work as a basis to compare
the effectiveness of hands-off self-teaching through mobile video games 
versus a guided approach to interact with them, and which of them yields more
satisfactory results.
