	abstract = {Raising Irrigation Productivity and Releasing Water for Intersectoral Needs' (RIPARWIN) is a study of river basin management in the Great Ruaha River, Tanzania. The objective of the study is to examine the theory that if irrigation productivity can be raised then water can be released to meet downstream and intra/intersectoral needs. In similar situations role-playing tools have proved to be effective in solving water management conflicts. The River Basin Game described in this working paper is a dialogue tool for decision-makers and water users that has been tested in Tanzania. It comprises a physical representation of the catchment in the form of a large wooden board. The central river flows between the upper catchment and a downstream wetland, and has on it several intakes into irrigation systems of varying sizes. Glass marbles that ‘flow' down the channel represent the river water. Participants place small sticks (like weirs) across the river to capture the marbles and scoop them into the irrigation systems where they sit in small holes—thereby meeting the water requirement of that particular plot of rice or irrigation activity. The players learn that being at the top of the river has advantages, whilst tail-end systems experience water shortages. The implications of different and new management strategies can be evaluated in depth by various stakeholder groups. The game promotes mutual understanding of different people's levels of access to water and allows participants to actively react to scenarios. Experience shows that participants become highly animated and by the end of the game, they have a good understanding of system dynamics and common property pitfalls, of which issues are most critical and of what solutions might be considered. If the game-playing is part of a workshop that is spread over two days, participants are able to contribute in detail to new solutions and institutional agreements. The second day is used to follow up on lessons learnt and to bring together various institutions to assist in improving the equity of water supply. This report includes a literature review of gaming in water resources management, a complete description of the game, details of the practical arrangements required to organize a game-playing session and possible approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of a session.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the methodology developed to collect, understand and merge viewpoints coming from different stakeholders in order to build a shared and formal representation of the studied system dealing with groundwater management in the low-lying atoll of Tarawa (Republic of Kiribati). The methodology relies on three successive stages. First, a Global Targeted Appraisal focuses on social group leaders in order to collect different standpoints and their articulated mental models. These collective models are partly validated through Individual Activities Surveys focusing on behavioural patterns of individual islanders. Then, these models are merged into a single conceptual one using qualitative analysis software. This conceptual model is further simplified in order to create a computer-assisted role-playing game.},

@article{Bots2007,
	abstract = { This article works toward a conceptual framework for designing games to support policy development for managing natural resources. The point of departure for this framework is a typology for functions of games in support of policy. This typology consists of six classes of functions of a policy game: research and analyze policy contexts as systems, design and recommend alternative solutions to a policy problem, provide advice to a client on what strategy to follow in the policy process, mediate between di ferent stakeholders, democratize policy development by actively bringing in stakeholder views, and clarify the values and arguments pertinent to the policy discourse. These functions are illustrated using specific examples of games that have been used in the domain of natural resource management (NRM). The framework discussed in this article may help game designers to match specific game properties (players, roles, rewards, and representations of the NRM context) with the intended function of the game in the policy-development process. },

@article{Barreteau2007,
	abstract = { This article presents a specific association of a role-playing game (RPG) and an agent-based model (ABM) aimed at dealing with a large range of time scales. Applications to the field of natural resource management lead one to consider the short time scale of resource use in practice at the same time as the longer ones related to resource dynamics or actors' investments. In their daily practice, stakeholders are translating their long-term strategies, a translation that is contextualized and combined with some co-occurring events. Long-term thinking is required for sustainable use of natural resources, but it should take into account its necessary adaptation on a short time scale. This raises the necessity for tools able to tackle jointly these various time scales. The similarity of architecture between computerized ABMs and RPGs makes them easy to associate in a hybrid tool, targeted at meeting this requirement. The proposition of this article is to allocate the representation of short time scales to computerized ABMs and the long ones to RPGs, while keeping the same static structural conceptual model, shared as a common root by both. This synergy is illustrated with PIEPLUE, an interactive setting tackling water-sharing issues. },

@article{Barnaud2007,
	abstract = {Decentralization of renewable resource management provides an opportunity for local stakeholders to increase their participation in decisions affecting them. Research should propose adapted methodologies and tools enabling the numerous stakeholders of complex socio-ecosystems to identify and discuss about possible solutions to their common problems. We show that in participatory modelling processes, simple models can be as useful as comprehensive and sophisticated ones to accommodate multiple interests among stakeholders, on the condition that the modelling and simulating process itself is carefully participatory, i.e. pays much attention to the initial socio-political context in which this participatory modelling process takes place to ensure the genuine participation of all concerned stakeholders (including the usually voiceless and ressource-poor ones). This assumption is discussed by drawing on a Companion Modelling (ComMod) experiment on water management in a Northern Thailand highland community. The basic principle of the ComMod approach is to develop simple simulation models integrating different stakeholders' points of view on the problem at stake, and to use them in communication platforms to explore and discuss collectively various scenarios for the future. By combining a preliminary analysis of the heterogeneous socio-political context with a very simple Agent-Based Model, a Role-Playing Game, individual interviews, and group debates, this ComMod process was efficient at stimulating collective learning and coordination among multiple stakeholders exploring pathways to solve their common water use problem.

	abstract = { SURFING GLOBAL CHANGE (SGC) serves as a procedural shell for attaining sustainable solutions for any interdisciplinary issue and is intended for use in advanced university courses. The participants' activities evolve through five levels from individual argumentation to molding one's own views for the “common good.” The paradigm of “ethics of negotiation” is implemented using a guided, step-by-step procedure that is characterized by mutual evaluation among the participants and by the dissolution of the traditional roles within education. Despite the existence of an elaborate structure of game rules, the setting of SGC provides for flexibility concerning the choice of themes, the definition of roles, the means of information retrieval, the selection of emphasis within the issue to be negotiated, the exploration of solutions, and notably, the allocation of “success” to the participants. SGC is therefore also usable as a tool for training in areas ripe for innovative social procedures. },
