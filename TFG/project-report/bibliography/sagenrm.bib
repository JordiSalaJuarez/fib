abstract = {Integrated management of coastal zones is crucial for the sustainable use of scarce and vulnerable natural resources and the economic survival of local and indigenous people. Conflicts of interest in coastal zones are manifold, especially in regions with high population pressure, such as Kerala (in southwest India). The simulation of a consultancy mission to Kerala described in this article was designed for a classroom situation but it can also be applied in settings with local stakeholders as a tool for social learning. Filmed interviews with real stakeholders contributed largely to the realism of the simulation and stimulated learning: Students aligned with local stakeholders and acquired professional skills as future analysts; local people learned about their own situation and the frames of other stakeholders.},

abstract = {A role-playing game (RPG) supported by computer simulations, called BUTORSTAR, has been developed in the context of a LIFE-Nature European Programme (2001-2005) aiming to improve reedbed management for the conservation of a vulnerable heron, the Eurasian Bittern. The agent-based model simulates the impacts of reedbed management resulting from decisions made by farmers, reed harvesters, hunters, and naturalists. The model is based on an archetypal wetland made of a virtual landscape. Different water regimes are proposed, each one adapted to a particular wetland use. Land-use and water-management decisions are made by the players at both estate and management-unit levels. These decisions are entered into the model each year as the results of the negotiation process between the players. This RPG is designed to promote student awareness of (a) biological and hydrological interdependencies and their dynamics on different spatial and temporal scales, (b) the technical and socioeconomic factors involved in the different types of reedbed use, and (c) the usefulness of the negotiation process for establishing collective management rules. It is shown that BUTORSTAR creates a continuum of learning that crosses the traditional boundaries between disciplines and allows players to conduct multipurpose experiments that contribute to their comprehensive understanding of socioecosystems.},

abstract = {Natural resource management of complex, adaptive socioecosystems requires a mix of good practice, policy, science, and intuition. We report here on a rapid and low-cost experiment in Lower Silesia, Poland, using modeling techniques to explore the potential to develop local ecological products. We focus our analysis on one particular group of products related to an “ancient” breed of chicken, the green-legged hen (GLH), with low resource requirements that could support a sustainable agriculture based on lower use of fertilizers and pesticides. The issues affecting farmers' commitment to adopt GLHs include availability of EU subsidies, the supportive role of NGOs, cooperation between producers, and uncertainty about the future profitability of a relatively untested product. We used this model to evaluate alternative scenarios, nurture the discussion among farmers, and stimulate them to take appropriate action. Gaming with a microworld interface was a crucial breakthrough experience for the farmers to accept and understand the scientific language and methods, and to join the community discussion by actively contributing to improving the model. This positive experience could be a crucial initial step toward the transition from intensive to extensive farming methods, thereby increasing the resilience of natural resource—based rural economies.},

@article{Krolikowska2007,
abstract = {This article describes a process of role-playing simulation (RPS) as it was used during an educational exer- cise in community dialogue in the Karkonosze Mountains region of southwest Poland. Over the past decade Karkonosze National Park, a regional tourist magnet, has provided an excellent example of environmental conflict emerging from the tensions between nature protection and economic development. The project we describe herein, a course called “Dynamics of Sustainable Development,” was designed to give students the direct experience of challenges in solving difficult social-ecological problems with many linked conflicts and tensions. We focused on RPS to emphasize factors crucial to compromise. Because teaching students about conflict solving was our main objective, the second indirect but expected experience was to stimulate dis- cussions among real stakeholders. Although RPS itself was not performed in the presence of the real stake- holders, their participation was ensured by inviting them for a final public debate where they got a chance to express their opinions about what they heard from the students. RPS offered the course participants not only a closer look at the conflict in the Karkonosze related to sustainable development, but also an insight into the general psychological background and evolution of conflicts.

abstract = {Landscape changes in Europe's rural areas seem to generate a more visible impact. This trend raises new questions on rural management and brings about a conflict between farmers' land-use patterns and public expectations, which are often exclusively based on esthetics. The aim of the SHRUB BATTLE board game is to help tutors make future rural planners aware of the complex relationships between landscape dynamics and agricultural practices. It provides a novel illustration of vegetation dynamics. Three players each pilot a plant species. Their pawns are spread across the board to progressively shape the landscape. Opposite them, a fourth player in the role of the animal farmer implements the best grassland-management practices to fulfill a landscape purpose. The interaction between players' strategies combined with random natural or cyclical events serves to illustrate the land-use conflicts occurring in the field. This pedagogical tool can be used to instill the fundamental principles of relationships between landscape dynamics and agricultural activities. This game makes students aware of the fact that rural planning requires multidisciplinary skills and knowledge of collective processes.},
