\section{Thrid prototype}

The design behind the third prototype was about managing a whole community
and seeing the effects of human consumption from an eagle-view perspective.
The player had to manage an entire town by building certain structures to
keep productivity up, as more and more villagers enter the town.

It gathers inpiration from The Houses Game \cite{Taylor1983}, as
the main mechanic is about space management, DUBES and others \cite{Bots2007},
because of their focus on policy development, and MAE SALAEP \cite{Barnaud2007}
because of its approach of dealing with chains of issues.

It strove to teach the player about how industries arise from individual
needs and how the former can greatly impact the natural resources in the area.

This prototype was chosen to become the final game because it was thought
to be an interesting challenge and a useful learning device for the players.

This section will not be expanded further, as in chapter
\ref{chap:final-game} there will be a more in-depth explanation of it.
