\section{Report Scope}

This document aims to provide a insightful description about the process of
building a mobile videogame about environmental sustainability using Unity
and a detailed explanation of two other approaches that the thesis authors
found to be not adequate.

The report, though, does not aim to be a step-by step guide on how to build such
a game, as it would prove very tedious and unproductive. It has been chosen
to only provide insight on key gameplay elements and technical decisions that
will enable future endeavours in this field to build a similar project
or extend the current one with easiness.
