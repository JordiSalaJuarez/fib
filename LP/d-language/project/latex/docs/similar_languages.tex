\section{Similar languages} \label{sec:similar_languages}

Althought D is intended to be a re-engineering of C++, it clearly is a distinct language, very different than its predecessor. Notably, D takes inspiration from programming languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, C\#, and Eiffel to achieve some of its functionality. \footcite{wikipedia_page} The following list explains the contributions each language made to D's design.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Java}: Classes, interfaces, garbage collector.
  \item \textbf{Python}: Functional programming, higher order functions such as \texttt{map} and \texttt{filter}.
  \item \textbf{Ruby}: Functional programming, higher order functions, condensed syntax, Sockets.
  \item \textbf{C\#}: Delegates, foreach, garbage collector.
  \item \textbf{Eiffel}: Code readability, object orientation.
\end{itemize}
