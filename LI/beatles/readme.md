### This is the solution to the following statement:

John, Paul and Ringo are rich. Here we will count their money in natural numbers that represent millions of Euros. They all have more than zero and at most 10. John has at least twice the amount that Ringo has. Paul has at least 3 more than John. Ringo has at least 3. A: Write all solutions. B: Write a Gnu Prolog program with finite domain constraint pr opagation to find all solutions. C: What are the domains of each variable after fully propagat ing the constraints (before the labeling)?

to execute, use `swipl beatles.pl` then, on the interactive shell, `main.`
